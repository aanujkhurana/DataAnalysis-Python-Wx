## **Project:** NSW Traffic Penalty Data Analysis and Visualization Tool üëÆüèª
## Dataset 
### NSW Traffic Penalty Data: 
https://www.kaggle.com/llihan/australia-nsw-traffic-penalty-data-20112017
**Features:**
- For a user-selected period, report the information of all penalty cases.
- For a user-selected period, produce a chart to show the distribution of cases in each offense code
- For a user-selected period, retrieve all cases captured by radar or camera based on offense description
- Analysing the cases caused by mobile phone usage - ie: trend over time, offense code, and so on.
- Generate Penalty Case Report,user will be able to see report for selected timeframe

**Project Description:** 
The NSW Traffic Penalty Data Analysis and Visualization Tool is intended to give users thorough understandings of New South Wales traffic penalty data. The dataset relating to different traffic offences can be analysed, visualised, and useful information can be obtained using this programme. It offers the following essential features and a user-friendly graphical interface:

**User Features:**
1. **Select a Time Period:** Users can choose a specific time period to focus on penalty case information.
2. **Generate Charts:** Users can generate charts to visualize the distribution of penalty cases by offense code.
3. **Filter by Offense Description:** Users can filter and view cases captured by radar or camera based on offense descriptions.
4. **Mobile Phone Usage Analysis:** Users can analyze cases related to mobile phone usage offenses, including trend analysis and offense code breakdown over time.
5. **Report Penalty Cases:** Users can retrieve information on all penalty cases within a user-selected period.

**Software Features:**
1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** The software loads and preprocesses the NSW Traffic Penalty Data, ensuring data quality and usability.
2. **Interactive GUI:** The tool offers an intuitive and user-friendly graphical user interface with components for user interactions.
3. **Data Retrieval:** Users can retrieve penalty case information for user-selected time periods.
4. **Chart Generation:** The software generates charts for visualizing the distribution of cases by offense code.
5. **Filtering and Display:** Users can filter and display cases captured by radar or camera based on user-provided offense descriptions.
6. **Mobile Phone Usage Analysis:** The software performs trend analysis and provides offense code breakdown for mobile phone usage offenses.

**Benefits:**
- Improved understanding of traffic penalty data in NSW.
- Enhanced decision-making for law enforcement agencies.
- Efficient resource allocation for road safety initiatives.
- Identification of trends and patterns in traffic offenses.

**Project Plan:** The project plan includes project initiation, data collection and preparation, user interface design, analysis and visualization modules development, integration, documentation, deployment, and project closure.

**Software Design Document:**
- Software design with components like data preprocessing, user interface, data retrieval, chart generation, filtering, and analysis.
- Flowchart illustrating the main workflow of the system.
- Functions and modules for loading data, preprocessing, chart generation, filtering, and analysis.

This project aims to provide a powerful yet user-friendly tool for analyzing and visualizing NSW Traffic Penalty Data, enabling users to make data-driven decisions and enhance road safety efforts, including the additional feature of reporting penalty cases.
