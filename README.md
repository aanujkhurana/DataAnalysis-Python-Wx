#  NSW Traffic Penalty Data Analysis and Visualization Tool üëÆüèªüöóüìäüö¶
### Dataset - NSW Traffic Penalty Data
You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/llihan/australia-nsw-traffic-penalty-data-20112017).

**Project Description:** 
The NSW Traffic Penalty Data Analysis and Visualization Tool provides users with in-depth insights into New South Wales traffic penalty data. This tool allows users to analyze, visualize, and obtain useful information from the dataset, offering the following features and a user-friendly graphical interface:

**User Features:**
1. **Select a Time Period:** Choose a specific time period to focus on penalty case information.
2. **Generate Charts:** Visualize the distribution of penalty cases by offense code.
3. **Filter by Offense Description:** Filter and view cases captured by radar or camera based on offense descriptions.
4. **Mobile Phone Usage Analysis:** Analyze cases related to mobile phone usage offenses, including trend analysis and offense code breakdown over time.
5. **Report Penalty Cases:** Retrieve information on all penalty cases within a user-selected period.

**Software Features:**
1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** Load and preprocess the NSW Traffic Penalty Data to ensure data quality and usability.
2. **Interactive GUI:** Offer an intuitive and user-friendly graphical user interface with components for user interactions.
3. **Data Retrieval:** Retrieve penalty case information for user-selected time periods.
4. **Chart Generation:** Generate charts to visualize the distribution of cases by offense code.
5. **Filtering and Display:** Filter and display cases captured by radar or camera based on user-provided offense descriptions.
6. **Mobile Phone Usage Analysis:** Perform trend analysis and provide offense code breakdown for mobile phone usage offenses.

**Benefits:**
- Improved understanding of traffic penalty data in NSW.
- Enhanced decision-making for law enforcement agencies.
- Efficient resource allocation for road safety initiatives.
- Identification of trends and patterns in traffic offenses.

**Project Plan:**
The project plan includes project initiation, data collection and preparation, user interface design, analysis and visualization modules development, integration, documentation, deployment, and project closure.

**Software Design Document:**
- Software design with components like data preprocessing, user interface, data retrieval, chart generation, filtering, and analysis.
- Flowchart illustrating the main workflow of the system.
- Functions and modules for loading data, preprocessing, chart generation, filtering, and analysis.

This project aims to provide a powerful yet user-friendly tool for analyzing and visualizing NSW Traffic Penalty Data, enabling users to make data-driven decisions and enhance road safety efforts, including the additional feature of reporting penalty cases.
